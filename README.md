Hello, Android! It's Duby!

This is the most basic example of how you can build Android app using
Duby. For stuff that goes beyond the build process, please see
[Garrett](http://github.com/technomancy/Garrett).

## Compilation

Copy local.properties.example to local.properties and edit it to point
to your SDK. If you're not targeting Android 2.1, you might need to
edit default.properties too.

Then you should be set to do "ant debug", and an apk file should be
generated in the bin/ directory.
